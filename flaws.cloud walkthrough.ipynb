    "hint 1 explained this challenge is not about injection or something you could find in other CTFs. The it hinted that `flaws.cloud` is hosted in S3 bucket, and permission in loose. So this just worked: `aws s3 ls s3://flaws.cloud`. There is a secret file which is suspicious, append that to the url and we got the link to the next level\n",

    "Look inside of the S3 bucket I see .git folder. Download the S3 files using `mkdir flaws3 %% cd flaws3 %% aws s3 sync s3://level3-9afd3927f195e10225021a578e6f78df.flaws.cloud/ .`\n",
    "then check git log. Looks like somebody made a mistake, and tried to cover it. So let's `git checkout f52ec03b227ea6094b04e43f475fb0126edb5a61` to get back to the first commit.\n",
    "now there is an access_key.txt file in the directory, which we can use to access the s3 bucket. Setup new access `aws configure --profile flaws` with just found credentials. Then `aws --profile flaws s3 ls` to list files under the profile.\n",
